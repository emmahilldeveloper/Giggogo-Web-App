Welcome to Giggogo!

I was inspired to create this web application as I encountered a real life problem that needed fixing. I'm in a cover band and find it extremely hard to book and communicate gig information with the venue and within the band members. So Giggogo is the one-stop, easy solution that I designed!

Band members are able to create and account and join an existing band, or create a new one. From there, they are able to search for venues based on desired filter criteria (hourly payrate, genre preference, location, etc.). Once gigs are booked, the band is able to effectively manage their performance calendar and are able to message the venue in-app.

This project uses Jinja and Javascript to generate front-end features. Some front-end features include Spotify music previews, Google Maps integrations, and a ChartJS display of monthly income. The search and messaging APIs are entirely designed by me from scratch and involve heavy use of database queries and asynchronous Javascript DOM manipulation. My back-end is Flask/Python-based, and I use PostgreSQL to house all user data. SQLAlchemy was a useful tool for me when interfacing between my server and my PostgreSQL database.

Despite never having coded prior to my bootcamp, I built this project in 4 weeks and am proud of my design.

Thank you,
